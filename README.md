Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.
Ans:
FR(Functional Requirements)
1. The ability for members to borrow and return books from their
desk/chamber.
2. The ability for members to extend the date of borrowing if no other
booking has been made.
3. The ability for the librarian to handle day to day book transactions
without any difficulties.
4. The ability for the librarian to add new records and remove records
from the system.
5. The ability for non-members to browse and search books online.
6. The feature of issuing or returning books should only be given to
members of the LIS.
7. The LIS should only run within the institute LAN.
NFR( Non Functional Requirements)
1. Confidential information such as passwords should not be stored in
plain text within the LIS.
2. The LIS should be accessible to multiple users at the same time.
3. The LIS should not have any restrictions on the number of users who
can use the software.
4. Reduced security risk of the software due to application running only
within the institute LAN.
5. The web application should be made using the latest HTML 5.
Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following
problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million
people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this
community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses
artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car
horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This
app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.
